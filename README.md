# QR Code Redirection Trap – Cybersecurity Awareness Project

**Project Objective:**  
To raise awareness about the risks of scanning random QR codes by simulating a realistic restaurant website trap.

---

## Project Idea

1. A user scans a QR code in a public place (e.g., a restaurant or flyer).
2. The QR leads to a well-designed fake restaurant website.
3. After a few seconds, the site **automatically redirects** to a fake login page (phishing page).
4. The user, thinking it’s real, may attempt to log in.
5. After submitting credentials, the user is redirected to an **awareness page** explaining the danger.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `index.html`: The fake restaurant homepage.
- `menuRedirect.html`: A realistic menu loading page that redirects after a few seconds.
- `phish.html`: A fake login page (e.g., simulating Instagram or Facebook).
- `awareness.html`: A final awareness message explaining the social engineering trick.
- `README.md`: This file.
